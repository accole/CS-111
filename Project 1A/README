lab1a.c

	A source file, which when compiled, changes the console into
	character-at-a-time, no-echo mode.  When executed with no arguments,
	lab1a logs keystrokes on the console until a user inputs ^D (Control
	D), indicating an EOF and exits the program.  When executed with the
	--shell=PROGRAM option, lab1a executes the program.  A common program
	used is /bin/bash, where lab1a will emulate the bash shell until the
	shell is exited with ^D or the process is force killed with ^C.

	Referenced the example from pipe(2) man page for forking with pipes:

	Referenced skeleton code for the assignment from TA Diyu Zhou slides.


Makefile

	default:  compiles and builds an executable from lab1a.c using
		  gcc and correct flags described in the project spec.
	clean:	  cleans the current directory to contain only the submission
		  files README, Makefile, and lab1a.c
	dist:	  creates a tarbell for submission (README, Makefile, lab1a.c)
