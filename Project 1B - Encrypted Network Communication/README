lab1b-client.c

	A source file that, when compiled, executes the local client to
	connect to the server on a specified --port=PORT.  The client
	will log user keystrokes on the console until a user inputs an
	EOF (^D) or kill (^C). After connecting to the server, the client
	will send input to the server and print the output of the program
	executed by the server.  If the --log=FILE option is used, the
	client will log the bytes sent and received between the client
	and the server in FILE.  If the --encrypt=KEYFILE option is used,
	the client will encrypt the data send to the server using the
	keyfile specified in the argument.

lab1b-server.c

	A source file that, when compiled, executes the local server
	on a specified --port=PORT, which is required.  The server will
	execute /bin/bash to execute a shell.  If the --encrypt=KEYFILE
	option is used, the server will encrypt the data sent to the
	client using the keyfile specified in the argument.  The server
	will report the shell exit status and signal when the client
	sends an EOF (^D) or kill (^C). 

my.key

	Contains the encryption key to encrypt and decrypt data sent from
	the client to the server and back using twofish cfb encryption
	sessions

Makefile

	default: compiles and builds executables for both lab1b-server.c
	         and lab1b-client.c using gcc and the correct flags.
	client:  compiles and builds only the lab1b-client.c executable
	server:  compiles and builds only the lab1b-server.c executable
	clean:   cleans the current directory to contain only the
		 submission files README, Makefile, my.key, lab1b-server.c
		 and lab1b-client.c
	dist:	 creates a tarbell for submission with files README,
		 Makefile, my.key, lab1b-client.c, lab1b-server.c

Usage
	$ ./lab1b-server --port=4500 --encrypt=my.key
	$ ./lab1b-client --port=4500 --log=log.txt --encrypt=my.key
