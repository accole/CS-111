Makefile:
	default:  creates an executable lab4b
	clean:	  cleans the repository to remove lab4b and the
		  distribution tar
	dist:	  creates the distribution tar file for submission
	check:	  runs a smoke test on the program


lab4b.c
	Source code, when compiled, reads input from user and outputs
	the temperature and time of reading at a given time interval
	PERIOD signified through an option.  The --scale option can
	also be used to switch between Celcius and Farenheit.  If the
	--log=LOGFILE option is used, all commands and outputs will be
	logged to the file.

NOTE****
	sudo needed to get past mraa_read_aio() segfault in sanity check
