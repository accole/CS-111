lab3a.c

	A source file, which when compiled, reads a file system image given
	in command line arguments.  The program will analyze the file system
	and summarizes the file system storage through print statements.
	Parts of the summary include the superblock, group summary, free
	I-node entries, I-node summary, directory entries, and indirect block
	entries.

Makefile

	default:  compiles and builds an executable from lab3a.c using
		  gcc and correct flags described in the project spec.
	clean:    cleans the current directory and removes previously
		  compiled executables and submission tarbells
	dist:	  creates a tarbell for submission (README, Makefile, lab3a.c)
